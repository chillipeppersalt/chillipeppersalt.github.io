Hi,there my name is SIMRAN and I have made this  project about content centric web-technologies which helps content-editor to focus on content rather than on designing it . This will help in enchancement of matter as required time will be given to the content . Then it is build using TravisCI for deployment[TravisCI](https://travis-ci.org/chillipeppersalt/deploy.svg?branch=master) .It is used to build & test software project hosted on github.The main agenda is to identify the problem that creeps during the development process as early as possible.so therefore complied regularly.
