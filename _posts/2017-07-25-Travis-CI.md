 **Travis CI** is _hosted,distributed,continous integration_ service used to build & test **software projects** on **_Github_**.
 

To ensure that they run unit test against _every build_ a **practise of continous integration** is followed that comprises of tools like _Travis CI or Jenkins_ etc.

**Contionous integration** is a _software development_ practice that is based on _continous integration_ of the code into shared repository.Every commit is then verified by **automated build**.
  
The **major ajenda** is to identitfy the problem during the _development process_ as early as possible,therefore should be integrated on regular basis.So,the developers spend more time on adding features then debugging it.

There is also an alternative to set-up an inspection of the code-style which helps to minimize the effort of the person who is reviewing the code  style & hence enhances the quality of the code & saves time.



                             **HOW IT WORKS**


  - Developers scrutinize the code locally on the computer.

  - When inspection completes, the changes are commited to the respective repositories

  - Then the repository sends the request to CI system.

  - CI system runs the job (test,coverage,check-syntax & stuff).
  
  - CI releases saved artifacts for testing.

  - If build fails then, CI sever reports it to the team 

  - The team then fixes it.
